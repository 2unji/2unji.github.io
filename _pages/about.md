I'm a final-year graduate student in the Literary and Cultural Studies program at Carnegie Mellon University. Currently, I'm immersed in my dissertation research, delving into diasporic experiences and counter-spaces within major North American urban centers. My work challenges dominant narratives while fostering collective imaginations of alternative modes of cohabitation.
