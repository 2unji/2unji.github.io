## Course Descriptions

### 76-106 Writing about Literature - Diasporic Literature: Home and (Be)Longing

**How do we understand our homes? Is it where we belong? Or, is it what we all long for?** 

In this course, we will be moving through selected works (the vignette, poetry, and graphic literature) by writers of African, Asian, and European descent who left their place of origin and have constructed their new homes in English-speaking countries. We will be exploring some key ideas in “diasporic studies,” such as trauma, melancholy, loss, home, and citizenship, and learn how to use “lens” texts to better appreciate literary works.

*Note: This is the course theme I proposed and was accepted by the department in the fall of 2020.*

### 76-107 Writing about Data

**Our lives are increasingly shaped by writing that involves numbers: newspapers routinely report the latest medical fads; politicians support their political agendas with both dubious and credible statistics; parents use data to decide where to buy a house and where to send their kids to school.**

This 7-week class will teach you to interpret and make arguments using both quantitative and qualitative data. In addition, you will learn to pay close attention to academic and popular genres and adapt your writing style to fit these genres.

*Note: This course description is adapted from the general course description provided by the department.*

### 76-207 DiverCities: Multiculturalism and North American Cities

**What does it mean to live in a city today? Specifically, what are the urban experiences of immigrant families spanning multiple generations, as well as sojourners like international students and transnational migrant workers? For people of color, what does it mean to claim a space in a global city of North America?**

Urban living offers freedom, anonymity, and a diverse cultural tapestry to its residents. However, as it closely intertwines individuals from varied backgrounds, conflicts can arise, often stemming from nationalism and biases against different ethnic groups. It is through these encounters with people of diverse backgrounds that new understandings and innovative forms of cohabitation emerge. This course delves into the multicultural essence of urban spaces and the dynamics among diverse populations coexisting within them. We will specifically focus on three prominent multicultural cities in North America: Los Angeles, New York, and Toronto.

*Note: This is the course I proposed and was accepted by the department in the fall of 2023.*

### 76-221 Books You Should Have Read By Now: Asian American Literature

**What defines Asian American literature, and how do Asian American authors aesthetically explore Asian American identity within their works? How is Asian American identity constructed, and in what ways does Asian American literature illuminate, challenge, or perpetuate this identity?**

This course offers an overview of the history of Asian American literature, delving into how contemporary Asian American literary works reflect and respond to pertinent sociopolitical issues. To explore a diverse range of Asian ethnicities and Asian American experiences, texts are drawn from writers of Indian, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Korean descent.

*Note: This is the course I proposed and was accepted by the department in the spring of 2024.*
